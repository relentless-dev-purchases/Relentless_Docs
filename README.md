One reason I chose Blazor (Credit to Steve Sanderson and the Microsoft team) is because the components, on the whole, make machine learning extremely easy when it come to creation, dissection, and reproduction of relevant code bodies. In other words, the interface and design is segmented such that labor intensive tech scraping is nowhere near the issue that it has been. 

In other words, for instance, imagine if you could translate design of everything from Authentication to Position with XML...

Possible with Blazor. No complicated regex, massive required machine learning base of information, etc. 

Have you ever noticed that the AI seems to write Node better than most other languages? If you've spent some time with it, you probably have. The uniformity of design surrounding the callbacks/promises design and generally simple directory structure follows the same principle I'm attempting to get at here.

Document is a draft. 

More to follow.

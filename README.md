One reason I chose Blazor (Credit to Steve Sanderson and the Microsoft team) is because the components, on the whole, make machine learning extremely easy when it come to creation, dissection, and reproduction of relevant code bodies. In other words, the interface and design is segmented such that labor intensive tech scraping is nowhere near the issue that it has been. 

In other words, for instance, imagine if you could translate design of everything from Authentication to Position with XML...

Possible with Blazor. No complicated regex, massive required machine learning base of information, etc. 

Have you ever noticed that the AI seems to write Node better than most other languages? If you've spent some time with it, you probably have. The uniformity of design surrounding the callbacks/promises design and generally simple directory structure follows the same principle I'm attempting to get at here.

Document is a draft. 

More to follow.

The overcomplication I have seen of folks talking about AI "Agents" has been fairly harmful to AI response, but it's such a new technology to so many people I suppose there's nothing to be done about that right now. This is extremely minimizing the important impact of things such as regression and vectors, but essentially you're looking at tasks being performed (especially if you are on a time limit) asynchronously and/or after a certain part of an informational relay has occurred as a result of a keyword easter egg being found. 

Whether we like it or not, the human brain (well, most of us) cannot seem to put together ONE map point as the central point of information flow for our existence. Information is conceptualized through matrix designs, more or less (not the movie, though they were intriguing), letting us perceive people, things, information, etc, moving around us in an x, y, z coordinate plane (VR, if you did not know, is programmed in Matrix mathmatical terms, and has been for decades). 

So, back to AI... 

Your first Agent is getting information on one part of the plane, say concatenating information from a web search to be presented for a decision at some point in the future. 

Your other Agent is applying what you consider is some extremely complicated math on a series of wikipedia articles and going to bring you a summary. 

No patronization... I've worked on AI for years... I simply don't want folks to sit there and think this field is untouchable. In fact, it's incredibly young (matrix video games or not), and just about everything you see out there is a collection of relatively "hacky" scripts that seem so eager to get done they can't start, much less finish.

It turns out that kibbles and bits is mentioned near the term "dog" at a mathematical rate that is much higher, statistically, than the rate of me being found near some dumb animal like a marmot or something. Congratulations, you've more or less passed Vectors 101. 

Apply metal to other conductive metal in a conducive medium and you've suddenly found a way to communicate. Pay attention and you've suddenly found a way you might be communicated with back. As much as you hear that I "built" this or that website or that someone "built" this or that software program, it's a bit of a misnomer... while there is SOMEWHAT of an "etch-a-sketch" atmosphere to it (time, believe it or not, is reliant more or less on a crystal and magnetism, but what difference does that have to the communication mentioned earlier?), the computer reproduces in circuit the information provided it from somewhere else this giant circle of networking had connected to it that shared it. Congratulations, you've passed News APIs 101. 

Sling some lights together, booleans, and discussions about which damn cat was brown and which damn cat was some other stupid color, and viola, you've just passed computer engineering 101.

Figuring out how addition can be subtraction gets you past 201. Go you. 

My point is that, besides having additional bodies in the industry and less glossy eyed looks of folks who really might be willing to converse just a bit ignorant, 
stop telling me about some hack job who put some python scripts together with someone else's technology that they in turn got from someone else themselves...

You people are by and large boring, one dimensional, amateur, and have no definable class structure.

I would rather be low class than no class.

So enjoy my work when it comes out. And if you didn't deserve me being riled up, apologies. And if you did, well... you know what to do... go act like "that dude you know" who "totally knows" some scripting language is going to put together something that adds a moment for us all to hear ourselves think. 

Whatever.

I stand behind my research indicating that the Captcha is long overdue for replacement by something more practical. Very easy to hop those things. My design of having the user send one personal photo they take (it can be anywhere, and used for quite a while for q+a extraction) and alterating which photo they send to different entities provides, I like to think, something relatively inherently secure to the point where we can all move past the annoying 2FA systems.
